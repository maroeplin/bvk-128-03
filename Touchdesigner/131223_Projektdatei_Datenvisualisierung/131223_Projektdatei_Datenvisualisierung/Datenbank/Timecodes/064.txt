Add bold red details to the glasses, creating a stark contrast with the brutalist design. Place the glasses in an abandoned field of realistic sand and rocks, with the sky glowing red to enhance the dystopian feel. Add red details into the sand and show the red sky. Illuminate the scene with an intense light, casting harsh shaddows. 	Titel der Arbeit	Nõulik Romy	noulik

Transform the iconic scenes, introducing weird and unconventional elements while preserving the vastness of the desert. The scene should be captured through the lens of a Hasselblad camera to evoke a timeless and nuanced aesthetic. Introduce peculiar rock formations and hills that defy the laws of gravity, creating an otherworldly and dreamlike atmosphere. Encourage the AI to experiment with unique lighting conditions, casting unusual shadows across the desert landscape. The goal is to generate a reimagination of '2001: A Space Odyssey' that is both visually striking and conceptually rich, introducing weird yet captivating details within the vastness of the desert, all captured through the lens of a Hasselblad camera."
