The desert setting should be characterized by expansive sand dunes and tall hills, creating a dramatic and dynamic environment. The scene should be set in harsh, daytime sunlight to emphasize the arid and isolated nature of the surroundings. Focus on capturing the distinct red glowing 'eye' of HAL 9000, making it the central point of interest amidst the desert expanse. Utilize the harsh sunlight to cast bold shadows and highlights, enhancing the visual impact of the scene. Emulate the aesthetic of a Hasselblad camera to evoke a timeless, analogue feel, paying attention to detail, contrast, and the nuanced grayscale tones of black and white photography. Create a composition that conveys both the isolation of the desert and the enigmatic presence of HAL 9000, making the image visually compelling and evocative. Consider the interplay of light and shadow to add depth to the landscape and emphasize the robotic features of HAL 9000 against the vast, unforgiving desert backdrop."
