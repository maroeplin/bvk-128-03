The computer is seen from a frontal perspective, as if the viewer is standing in front of it. The computer is a large, square machine. It is made of copper, brass, and other steampunk materials, such as gears, pipes, and valves. The computer is also covered in leather. Steam rises from vents in the computer. A bright red-light shines from the center of the computer, illuminating the room in a reddish glow. The computer is installed in the cockpit of a steampunk spaceship. The cockpit is also made of steampunk materials, primarily copper and brass pipes and plates. Through the windows, the dark expanse of space can be seen, with planets or the surface of the moon possibly visible.  The room is predominantly illuminated by the red light from the computer, but in some places, it mixes with cool blue light from the outside.	Speicherzentrum HAL 9000	Lena Schmidt	schmidt
