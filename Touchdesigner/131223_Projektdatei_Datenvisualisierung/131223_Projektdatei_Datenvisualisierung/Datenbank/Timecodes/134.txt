The outer shell, a symphony of undulating curves and fluid lines, mirrors the graceful dance of celestial bodies, while the material itself hints at a harmonious blend of advanced polymers and lightweight alloys, providing both protection and agility.The helmet, a centerpiece of technological artistry, embraces a minimalist visor with an expansive field of view, borrowing from Lovegrove's penchant for sleek, unobtrusive interfaces.

Taut facial muscles convey a sense of urgency, while furrowed brows reveal the weight of their clandestine conversation. A subtle tension lingers in their posture, shoulders slightly hunched, as they exchange guarded glances, acutely aware of the AI's watchful gaze. Both individuals sport discreet attire, attempting to blend into the uniform surroundings, yet their eyes betray a flicker of resistance and determination against the sterile backdrop of their controlled existence. their faces are worn out and their shoulders hang. their eyes are sunken in and their skin looks old and has a grey tint realism close-up of faces  Old Age  Frieda Kunert  kunert
