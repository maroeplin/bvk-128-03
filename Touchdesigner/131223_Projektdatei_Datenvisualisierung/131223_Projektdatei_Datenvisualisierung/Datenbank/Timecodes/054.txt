The monolith is seen from a close-up perspective, as if the viewer is standing at its base and looking up at it. The monolith is rectangular and towers above the viewer. It is made of copper, brass, and other steampunk materials, such as gears, pipes, and valves. The monolith is also covered in leather. Steam rises from vents in the monolith. The monolith glows faintly from within, illuminating the night scene. The scene is set at night. The sky is dark blue, and there are a few stars visible. There are also a few small clouds in the sky. There is no landscape visible in the image. The overall scene is dark, cool, and slightly misty. It has a calm, mystical, and futuristic atmosphere.

The desert landscape should seamlessly transition into a vast Stone Age era terrain. The image should be captured in the style of an analogue camera, akin to a Hasselblad, to evoke the cinematic charm of the 1968 film. The juxtaposition of the futuristic Monolith and the ancient Stone Age world should be central to the composition, creating an otherworldly, ethereal ambiance under the moon's gentle glow.

The scene should evoke a sense of mystery and discovery. The Monolith should consist of a tall mysterious object that as no specific structure. Use a vintage colour scheme to emulate the classic look of an analogue camera, specifically referencing the aesthetics of a Hasselblad. Pay attention to contrast and shadows to create a dramatic and visually striking composition. Ensure that the Monolith stands as an enigmatic and dominant presence in the scene, with the surrounding desert landscape unfolding in the backdrop. Consider the play of light and shadows to enhance the cinematic quality of the image, and aim for a timeless, otherworldly atmosphere. The final image should reflect the juxtaposition of advanced extraterrestrial technology within a primitive Earth setting, capturing the essence of the iconic Monolith in a unique and visually compelling way."
