Emphasize the stark contrast between the retro-modern appearance of the food tray, reminiscent of the 1960s, and the rugged, natural surroundings of the desert. Position the food tray in a way that it stands out prominently against the arid landscape, highlighting the juxtaposition of technology and nature. Capture the scene from a stark bird's-eye view, allowing for the exploration of distorted proportions. Leverage the soft, natural lighting of the desert, allowing the details of the retro-modern design to shine. Use a Hasselblad camera to evoke a timeless aesthetic, emphasizing the intricate details of the food tray. Encourage the AI to experiment with composition and angles to create a visually compelling image that not only showcases the distinctive design of the tray but also tells a story of unexpected juxtaposition within this unconventional setting."
