Immerse the chair in an expansive desert landscape, creating a composition that is not ordinary but rather intriguing and captivating. Position the Djinn chair within the desert environment in a way that enhances its unique design and form. Encourage the AI to experiment with angles, perspectives, and distances to create a visually striking composition. Emphasize the chair's bold color against the natural tones of the desert. Consider the interplay of light and shadow in the desert setting to add depth and dimension to the scene. Aim for an image that not only showcases the distinctive design of the Djinn chair but also tells a story of unexpected juxtaposition and visual interest within the unconventional desert environment. This prompt challenges the AI to explore creative and non-traditional approaches to compose an image that captivates viewers by combining the iconic chair with the vast and intriguing backdrop of a desert landscape."

The astronaut has rested his head in the helmet on one hand thinking about his next move. They are playing chess against each other on the table. The human-like projection consists of a slightly transparent shimmer with facial features of an upright sitting figure emanating from a small technological device. They are out in the open. The background landscape is that of a deserted, dystopian planet that is hostile to life. An eerie and blurry light that seems to have no source is giving everything a surreal atmosphere  Zeit totschlagen	Swaantje Meyer	meyer
