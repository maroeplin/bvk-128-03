The artificial intelligence is a human-looking light projection. The astronaut has rested his head in the helmet on one hand thinking about his next move. They are playing chess against each other on the table. The human-like projection consists of a slightly transparent shimmer of an upright sitting figure emanating from a small technological device. They are out in the open. The background landscape is that of a deserted, dystopian planet that is hostile to life.
