This desert environment serves as an unconventional backdrop at any time of the day, providing a surreal contrast to the futuristic nature of the tray. Craft the food tray with a distinctive design, featuring a metal plate adorned with strange and otherworldly foods and goods. Experiment with the surreal combination of elements on the tray to evoke a sense of curiosity and wonder. Capture the scene using a Hasselblad Camera in an analogue style, specifically with a wide-angled lens, around 14mm, to create a visually immersive and expansive composition. Encourage the AI to play with proportions and angles, bringing out the unique qualities of both the tray and the desert landscape. This prompt aims to produce an image that not only showcases the retro-futuristic aesthetic of the Food Tray but also invites viewers to explore the unexpected and imaginative intersection of technology and surreal desert surroundings."
