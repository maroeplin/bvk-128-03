07	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maroeplin/bvk-128-03/main/Timecodes/014/03_Adaptionen_Schmidt_Monolith_014.jpg	Adaption	A realistic and detailed image of a steampunk monolith. The monolith is seen from a close-up perspective, as if the viewer is standing at its base and looking up at it. The monolith is rectangular and towers above the viewer. It is made of copper, brass, and other steampunk materials, such as gears, pipes, and valves. The monolith is also covered in leather. Steam rises from vents in the monolith. The monolith glows faintly from within, illuminating the night scene. The scene is set at night. The sky is dark blue, and there are a few stars visible. There are also a few small clouds in the sky. There is no landscape visible in the image. The overall scene is dark, cool, and slightly misty. It has a calm, mystical, and futuristic atmosphere.
