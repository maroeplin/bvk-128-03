The spaceship is round, and it is made of copper, brass, pipes, gears, valves, and leather. The spaceship is powered by a steam engine, and it is releasing steam from its exhaust pipes. The spaceship is lit up by a dim red glow from its portholes. The perspective is from above, looking down at the spaceship. The spaceship takes up the majority of the image, and it looms over the landscape. The landscape below the spaceship is a vast desert, and it is set in the early evening hours. The sky is a dark blue, and the sun is just starting to set. The landscape is dotted with large, organic rock formations. The horizon is hazy. The overall scene is dark, cool, and slightly misty. It has calm, mystical, and futuristic atmosphere.	Raumschiff Roboter im All	Lena Schmidt	schmidt
