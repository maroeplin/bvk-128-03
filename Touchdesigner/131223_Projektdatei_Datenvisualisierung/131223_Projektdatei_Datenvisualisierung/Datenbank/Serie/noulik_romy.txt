Add bold red details to the glasses, creating a stark contrast with the brutalist design. Place the glasses in an abandoned field of realistic sand and rocks, with the sky glowing red to enhance the dystopian feel. Add red details into the sand and show the red sky. Illuminate the scene with an intense light, casting harsh shaddows. 	Covenant_Goggles_02	Nõulik Romy	noulik
