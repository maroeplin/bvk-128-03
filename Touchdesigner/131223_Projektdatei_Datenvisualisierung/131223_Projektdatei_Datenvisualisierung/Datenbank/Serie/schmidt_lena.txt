The figure is inspired by the mechanical doll from the film “Hugo Cabret” by Martin Scorsese from 2011. In comparison to the film “2001: A Space Odyssey”, the figure is adapted in the steampunk style and consists of elements characteristic of the style, such as copper and brass plates and pipes, gears, valves, belts and additional leather elements. The figure’s face which is clearly visible, consists of a smooth copper and brass plate. The eyes reveal the interior of the machine, with gears and pipes. The body consists if a frame made of copper and brass pipes, through which the interior of the figure can be seen. Inside is the steam-powered machine, in the center of which the red light of the artificial intelligence HAL9000 from the film “2001: A Space Odyssey” by Stanley Kubrick shines. The machine also emits steam. The red light from inside the figure illuminates the image, the background behind the figure is black. The person can be seen with head and upper body, so the perspective is close	Wiedergeburt (Serie 02/02)	Lena Schmidt	schmidt
