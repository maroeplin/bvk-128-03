The monolith is rectangular and tall, and it is made of copper, brass, gears, valves, and leather. The monolith has a faint glow, which creates a sense of wonder and awe. The landscape is a vast desert, and it is set in the late afternoon hours. The sky is a dark orange, and the sun is just starting to set. The landscape is dotted with large, organic rock formations. The horizon is hazy. The monolith takes up a large portion of the image, and it looms over the landscape. The overall scene is dark, cool, and slightly misty. It has a calm, mystical, and futuristic atmosphere.	Monolith in Wüstenlandschaft (Serie 01/02)	Lena Schmidt	schmidt
